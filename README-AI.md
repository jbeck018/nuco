## Using AI Features in Nuco-App

### Enabling AI Features

1. Log in to Nuco-App
2. Navigate to your organization settings
3. Go to the "AI Settings" tab
4. Enable the AI features you want to use
5. Configure model preferences and usage limits

### Available AI Features

Depending on your subscription plan, you can access:

- **Smart Search**: Semantic search across your organization's data
- **Content Generation**: AI-assisted writing and content creation
- **Document Analysis**: Summarization and extraction of key information
- **Conversation AI**: Intelligent chatbots for customer support
- **Data Insights**: AI-powered analytics and recommendations

## AI Feature Limits

AI feature availability depends on your organization's subscription plan:

- **Free Plan**: Limited AI features
- **Starter Plan**: Basic AI features
- **Pro Plan**: Advanced AI features
- **Enterprise Plan**: Full AI suite with custom model training

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering

For optimal results with AI models:

1. Be specific and clear in your prompts
2. Provide context and examples
3. Break complex tasks into smaller steps
4. Use system messages to set the tone and behavior

### Cost Management

To manage AI integration costs:

1. Set usage limits per user or organization
2. Implement caching for common queries
3. Use smaller models for simpler tasks
4. Monitor usage patterns and optimize accordingly

### Privacy and Security

When working with AI:

1. Do not send sensitive or personal information to AI models
2. Implement proper data sanitization
3. Review AI-generated content before using it in production
4. Consider using on-premises or private models for sensitive data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limiting**: If you encounter rate limits, implement backoff strategies and consider upgrading your API tier.

2. **Model Availability**: Some models may have waitlists or limited availability. Check the provider's status page for updates.

3. **Token Limits**: If you hit token limits, try breaking your input into smaller chunks or summarizing before sending to the AI.

4. **Quality Issues**: If AI responses aren't meeting expectations, refine your prompts and consider using a more capable model.

### Debugging

To debug AI integration issues:

1. Check application logs for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Test with minimal prompts to isolate issues
4. Consult the AI provider's documentation for specific error codes
