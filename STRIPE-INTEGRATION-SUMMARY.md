# Stripe Integration Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Stripe integration implemented in Nuco-App for subscription management and billing. The integration enables organizations to subscribe to different plans, manage their billing information, and access subscription details through a user-friendly interface.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **Stripe Client**: Created a reusable Stripe client in `src/lib/stripe/client.ts` that initializes the Stripe SDK with the API key from environment variables.
- **Environment Variables**: Added necessary environment variables for Stripe integration in `.env.example`:
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- Updated the database schema to include Stripe-related fields in the organization table:
  - `stripeCustomerId`: To store the Stripe customer ID for each organization
  - `subscriptionId`: To store the active subscription ID
  - `subscriptionStatus`: To track the current status of the subscription
  - `priceId`: To store the current price plan ID
  - `currentPeriodEnd`: To track when the current billing period ends

### 3. Webhook Handling
- Implemented a webhook handler in `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` to process Stripe events:
  - Subscription created/updated/deleted events
  - Payment succeeded/failed events
  - Customer subscription trial events
  - Secure webhook verification using Stripe's signature validation

### 4. Stripe Service
- Created a service layer in `src/lib/stripe/service.ts` with functions for:
  - Creating and managing customers
  - Creating checkout sessions for subscription sign-up
  - Creating customer portal sessions for subscription management
  - Retrieving subscription and billing information
  - Handling subscription status updates

### 5. tRPC Router Updates
- Enhanced the organization router in `src/lib/trpc/routers/organization.ts` with new procedures:
  - `getSubscriptionStatus`: Retrieves the current subscription status for an organization
  - `getAvailablePlans`: Fetches available pricing plans from Stripe
  - `createCheckoutSession`: Creates a Stripe checkout session for subscription sign-up
  - `createCustomerPortalSession`: Creates a Stripe customer portal session for subscription management

### 6. UI Components
- **OrganizationBilling Component**: Created a comprehensive UI component in `src/components/organizations/OrganizationBilling.tsx` that:
  - Displays current subscription status and details
  - Shows available pricing plans
  - Provides buttons to manage billing or subscribe to plans
  - Handles loading states and error scenarios
  - Uses toast notifications for user feedback

- **Organization Settings Integration**: Updated the organization settings page in `src/app/org/[slug]/settings/page.tsx` to include a billing tab that renders the OrganizationBilling component.

### 7. Documentation
- Created detailed documentation in `README-STRIPE.md` covering:
  - Setup instructions for Stripe integration
  - Testing guidelines using Stripe's test cards and CLI
  - Implementation details and architecture overview
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Resources and references to Stripe documentation

## Benefits of Implementation
- **Flexible Subscription Management**: Organizations can easily subscribe to different plans, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions.
- **Secure Payment Processing**: All payment information is handled securely by Stripe, reducing compliance burden.
- **Automated Billing**: Recurring billing is handled automatically, with proper invoice generation and delivery.
- **Self-Service Portal**: Users can manage their own subscriptions and payment methods through the Stripe Customer Portal.
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time updates to subscription status based on events from Stripe.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The implementation is designed to scale with the application's growth.

## Setup Requirements
To complete the setup, the following steps are required:
1. Create a Stripe account and obtain API keys
2. Set up the required environment variables
3. Create products and pricing plans in the Stripe dashboard
4. Configure webhook endpoints in the Stripe dashboard
5. Test the subscription flow with Stripe's test cards

## Future Enhancements
- Implement usage-based billing for specific features
- Add support for multiple currencies
- Enhance analytics for subscription metrics
- Implement promotional codes and discounts
- Add support for invoicing and credit notes
