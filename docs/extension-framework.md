# Extension Framework Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for the Nuco-App Extension Framework, which will allow third-party developers to extend the functionality of the application through custom extensions.

## Overview

The Extension Framework is designed to be:

1. **Secure**: Extensions run in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions
2. **Flexible**: Support for different types of extensions (Slack, Chrome, Salesforce)
3. **Versioned**: Extensions can be updated independently of the core application
4. **Discoverable**: Extensions can be published to a marketplace for users to discover

## Extension Types

The framework will support the following extension types:

1. **Slack Extensions**: Extend the functionality of the Slack integration
2. **Chrome Extensions**: Provide browser-based functionality
3. **Salesforce Extensions**: Integrate with Salesforce-specific features
4. **API Extensions**: Add custom API endpoints to the application

## Manifest Schema

Each extension must provide a manifest file (`extension.json`) that defines its metadata, permissions, and entry points:

```json
{
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A description of my extension",
  "author": {
    "name": "Developer Name",
    "email": "developer@example.com",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  },
  "type": "slack|chrome|salesforce|api",
  "entryPoints": {
    "main": "./src/index.js",
    "settings": "./src/settings.js",
    "background": "./src/background.js"
  },
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "network",
    "slack:read",
    "slack:write"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "configurable": true,
    "schema": {
      "apiKey": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "API Key for the service"
      },
      "enableFeature": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": true,
        "description": "Enable this feature"
      }
    }
  },
  "hooks": [
    {
      "event": "slack:message",
      "handler": "handleSlackMessage"
    },
    {
      "event": "app:startup",
      "handler": "handleAppStartup"
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Endpoints

The Extension Framework will expose the following API endpoints:

### Extension Management

- `GET /api/extensions`: List all installed extensions
- `GET /api/extensions/:id`: Get details of a specific extension
- `POST /api/extensions`: Install a new extension
- `PUT /api/extensions/:id`: Update an existing extension
- `DELETE /api/extensions/:id`: Uninstall an extension
- `POST /api/extensions/:id/enable`: Enable an extension
- `POST /api/extensions/:id/disable`: Disable an extension

### Extension Marketplace

- `GET /api/marketplace/extensions`: List all available extensions in the marketplace
- `GET /api/marketplace/extensions/:id`: Get details of a specific extension in the marketplace
- `POST /api/marketplace/extensions/:id/install`: Install an extension from the marketplace

### Extension Settings

- `GET /api/extensions/:id/settings`: Get the settings of an extension
- `PUT /api/extensions/:id/settings`: Update the settings of an extension

### Extension Hooks

- `POST /api/extensions/:id/hooks/:hook`: Trigger a hook for an extension

## Security Considerations

### Sandboxing

Extensions will run in a sandboxed environment with limited access to the host application. This will be implemented using:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restrict the resources that extensions can load
2. **Iframe Sandboxing**: Run extension UI components in sandboxed iframes
3. **Permission System**: Extensions must request permissions for specific actions

### Permission System

Extensions must request permissions for specific actions, which users must approve during installation. Permissions include:

- `storage`: Access to extension-specific storage
- `network`: Make network requests to external services
- `slack:read`: Read data from Slack
- `slack:write`: Send messages to Slack
- `salesforce:read`: Read data from Salesforce
- `salesforce:write`: Write data to Salesforce

### Data Isolation

Each extension will have its own isolated storage space to prevent data leakage between extensions.

## Extension Lifecycle

1. **Installation**: User installs the extension from the marketplace or uploads a custom extension
2. **Initialization**: Extension is loaded and initialized when the application starts
3. **Execution**: Extension runs in response to events or user actions
4. **Update**: Extension can be updated to a new version
5. **Disable/Enable**: Extension can be temporarily disabled or re-enabled
6. **Uninstallation**: Extension is completely removed from the application

## Extension Development

### Development Tools

- **CLI Tool**: A command-line tool for creating, testing, and packaging extensions
- **Development Server**: A local server for testing extensions during development
- **Validation Tool**: A tool for validating extension manifests and code

### Publishing Process

1. **Development**: Developer creates the extension locally
2. **Testing**: Developer tests the extension using the development tools
3. **Packaging**: Developer packages the extension for distribution
4. **Submission**: Developer submits the extension to the marketplace
5. **Review**: Marketplace administrators review the extension for security and quality
6. **Publication**: Extension is published to the marketplace

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

1. Design the extension manifest schema
2. Implement the extension loading system
3. Create the sandboxing environment
4. Implement the permission system
5. Develop the extension API endpoints

### Phase 2: Extension Types

1. Implement Slack extension support
2. Implement Chrome extension support
3. Implement Salesforce extension support
4. Implement API extension support

### Phase 3: Marketplace

1. Create the extension marketplace UI
2. Implement extension installation from the marketplace
3. Develop the extension review process
4. Implement extension updates and versioning

### Phase 4: Developer Tools

1. Create the CLI tool for extension development
2. Implement the development server
3. Develop the validation tool
4. Create documentation for extension developers

## Conclusion

The Extension Framework will provide a powerful way for developers to extend the functionality of the Nuco-App while maintaining security and stability. By following a structured approach to extension development and management, we can create a vibrant ecosystem of extensions that enhance the value of the application for users.
